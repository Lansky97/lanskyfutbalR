# lanskyfutbalR

This repo contains functions to run a football simulation model which can be used to forecast individual matches as well as the remaining league season. 

The only input external to the repo is using [wordlfootballR](https://github.com/JaseZiv/worldfootballR) package to get match results data via the fb_match_results() function

There are a couple functions designed to create graphics for displaying model output. Examples of such graphics can be found in the outputs folder

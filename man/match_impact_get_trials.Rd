\title{Get Trials for a Specific Match Outcome}
\usage{
match_impact_get_trials(projection, game_id, outcome)
}
\arguments{
\item{projection}{A list containing the simulation results, including a data frame \code{simmed_results} with columns for gameID, trial, home_win, draw, and away_win.}

\item{game_id}{An integer specifying the game ID for which to retrieve the trials.}

\item{outcome}{A character string specifying the match outcome to filter by (e.g., "home_win", "draw", "away_win").}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the trial numbers where the specified outcome occurred for the given game ID.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the trial numbers for a specified match outcome (e.g., home win, away win, draw) for a given game ID from the simulation results.
}
\details{
This function filters the \code{simmed_results} data frame to find the trials where the specified match outcome occurred for the given game ID. It returns a vector of trial numbers.
}

\dontrun{
  projection <- list(simmed_results = data.frame(gameID = c(1, 1, 2, 2),
                                                 trial = c(1, 2, 1, 2),

                                                 draw = c(0, 1, 0, 0),
                                                 away_win = c(0, 0, 1, 0)))
